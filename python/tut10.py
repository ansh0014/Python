# now we learn about the if,else and elif in python
# if (condition):
  #statments to be executed
  #if condition is true
# else:
  #statment to be executed
  #if condition is not true

# this is syntax in python
# a=int(input("Enter a no: "))
# if  (a%2==0):
   
#     print("Even")
# else:
#     print("odd")

# if a>0:
#     print("Postive")
# elif a<0:
#     print("negative")
